# Library Management System (C++)

A console-based Library Management System developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
The system allows users to manage books through a simple and interactive menu.

## Features
- View available books
- Borrow books from the library
- Return borrowed books
- View borrowed books
- Add new books to the library
- Menu-driven user interface

## OOP Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Private data members
- Public member functions
- Separation of functionality into methods

## Data Handling
- Uses vector<string> to store available and borrowed books
- Prevents invalid operations (wrong menu choice, invalid book number)
- Handles user input safely

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using any C++ compiler
2. Run the executable
3. Follow the on-screen menu instructions.

##  Notes
- This project focuses on logic, structure, and OOP design rather than graphical interfaces.
- Designed to simulate a real-world system in a simplified console environment.

##  Language
- C++
