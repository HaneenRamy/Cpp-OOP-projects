# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects focused on applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through practical, console-based applications.

The projects emphasize structured design, class-based architecture, and real-world problem modeling using C++. They are built to demonstrate clean logic, data management, and user interaction via menus.

## Concepts Applied
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Data abstraction
- Vectors and dynamic data storage
- Input validation
- Menu-driven console applications

##  Projects Included
- Library Management System  
- Bank Management System  
- Student Management System  

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- Source code (.cpp)
- A dedicated README explaining the project
- Clear functionality and user interaction flow

## Tools & Language
- Language: C++
- IDE: Any C++ compatible IDE (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, VS Code, etc.)
- Platform: Console-based applications

##  Purpose
These projects were built as part of my learning journey in C++ and OOP, with a focus on writing structured, readable code and solving problems in a practical way.

Feel free to explore the code and project structure.
