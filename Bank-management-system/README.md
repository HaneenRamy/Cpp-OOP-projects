# Bank Management System (C++)

A console-based Bank Management System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
The system simulates basic banking operations through a clean, menu-driven interface.

## Features
- View all active bank accounts
- Deposit money using real account numbers
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Input validation and error handling
- Clear and structured menu navigation

## Concepts Applied
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Vectors and dynamic data storage
- Input validation
- Realistic system modeling

## Design Overview
- Each bank account is represented by an Account class
- All accounts are stored in a vector inside the BankSystem class
- Account operations are performed using account numbers, not array indexes

## How to Run
1. Compile the program
2. Run the executable
3. Follow the on-screen menu instructions

## Tools & Language
- Language: C++
- Type: Console application
- IDE: Any C++ compatible IDE

## Notes
This project focuses on clean structure, correct logic, and realistic behavior rather than graphical interfaces.
